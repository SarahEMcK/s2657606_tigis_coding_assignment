TASK 1
.py file name: some_file.py
about: plot data from plenty.data

---

This file contains functions which will allow you to plot data from the plenty.data file (or, with some changes to the if __name__ == "__main__" section, any similar file containing coordinate points) against a standard x,y axis.  The read_data function reads in the data from the file and the plot_data function plots it.

When run is pressed a line graph should appear in a new figure, plotting each of the points in the plenty.data file.  

The numpy and matplotlib.pyplot libraries were imported in this file.  

Happy coding!!!
